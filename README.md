# Combined Rules for Skin Detection
This repo is host for the experiments with combined rules to detect skin color pixels in colored images.

## How do I get setup?
You can open this project within Visual Studio or compile the source code using gcc in Linux/Mac

## What is in each branch?
We have four different branches, each one with:

* master

The original source code from Nadia Brancati paper.

* reverse

The source code changed to refactor the correlation rules to put them in terms of the estimated value of Pcr

* combined

The combination of the rules given in the original (master branch) and reverse hipothesis.

* neighbors

A neighborhood extend method based on the combined rules.
